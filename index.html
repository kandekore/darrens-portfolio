            Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used
            in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is
            attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is
            thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
            “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.” The
            purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
            (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the
            layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with
            meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant
            to be on design, not content. The passage experienced a surge in
            popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their
            dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers
            bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the
            web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to
            get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem
            ipsum.
