# darrens-portfolio

#Turned out to be a complete labour of love :) 
#so I didn't leave enough time to add good comments and impliment structure as learned in previous project 
#Due to lack of specific applications I have made sub pages to work I have done previously, I have linked the sole application made so far (last weeks project) in the way as directed.
#I started to fiddle and dug a few holes I had trouble getting out of with the CSS, if I'd have had more time I would have stripped back the CSSMeets.

#Site meets the following criteria

##WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
##WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
##WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
##WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
##WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application
#WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

#Additional features include 

##Font awesome CSS added at line 6 in index.html
##Portfolio boxes expand on desktop hover
##Text & Box shadow throughout
